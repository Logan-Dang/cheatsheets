# Problem Decomposition Guide (Recursive Method)

Use these 4 steps to break down any complex problem into manageable parts.  
Apply the steps **recursively** to each part until every piece becomes simple to solve.

---

## Step 1: Is this problem asking for multiple steps?

- Does solving this involve doing more than one thing in sequence?
- Could you break it into distinct stages?

**If yes:**

- List the steps in order.
- Apply these 4 steps recursively to each one.

---

## Step 2: Are there multiple conditions or paths?

- Does the problem involve different situations, cases, or decisions?
- Look for words like **if**, **unless**, **either**, or **compare**.

**If yes:**

- List each path or case separately.
- Apply these 4 steps recursively to each one.

---

## Step 3: What do I need for this problem?

- Is anything missing — a value, formula, fact, or definition?
- What do you need _in hand_ to actually solve the problem?

**If yes:**

- Add a new step: "Get what I need."
- Apply these 4 steps recursively to that subproblem.

---

## Step 4: Given what I have (or have found), how do I solve this part?

- Is the subproblem now solvable?
- Can I write a clear answer or take an obvious action?

**If yes:**

- Solve it.
  **If not:**
- Return to **Step 1** for this part.

## 🔁 Important: Always Allow Recursion

> If you're ever stuck or unsure, take the confusing part and **go back to Step 1** for just that piece.

This is not a linear checklist — it’s a recursive loop.  
Each step helps you shrink the problem until it becomes clear and solvable.
